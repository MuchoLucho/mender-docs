## Introduction

[Secure Boot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFI#Secure_Boot?target=_blank) is a service offered by
the [UEFI boot firmware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFI?target=_blank) which verifies that all
executable code loaded during the boot process is
signed by a trusted key. This ensures that none of
the privileged software on the device has been
tampered with. In a Linux system, this encompasses
the boot loader, the kernel, and device drivers.

! Note that Secure Boot does not provide filesystem integrity, only boot loader, kernel and device
! driver (kernel module) integrity. If you are interested in filesystem integrity checking, the
! [dm-verity](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/device-mapper/verity.html?target=_blank)
! framework may be what you are looking for.

## Support

The signatures used by Secure Boot are embedded in the binary files themselves, and as such, are
largely independent of the Mender Client; it will just deploy whatever files the update contains,
with or without Secure Boot signatures. This means that in general, if a system was Secure Boot
compliant before introducing the Mender Client, it will keep being compliant after introducing it.

However, how you build the image affects whether it is Secure Boot compliant or not. Although the
Mender Client supports Secure Boot, not all of Mender's image building facilities do.

For the Yocto family of operating system images,
[meta-mender](https://github.com/mendersoftware/meta-mender?target=_blank) is the Yocto layer used
to enable building of Mender compatible dual rootfs images. For the most part, signing for Secure
Boot compliant images happens independently from Mender, and Mender will just use the signed
components without "getting in the way" of Secure Boot.

However, some things are worth noting regarding the current implementation:

* For ARM systems that use [GRUB integration](../02.Bootloader-support/01.GRUB) (the default):

    * If the system previously used U-Boot only, then Mender's Yocto layer introduces either the
      `grub-efi` or `grub-efi-mender-precompiled` recipe into the build. Make sure that the binary
      produced in either of these recipes is
      signed.

    * On ARM, U-Boot is usually used as a UEFI provider which loads GRUB. U-Boot therefore needs to
      have UEFI Secure Boot built in (`CONFIG_EFI_SECURE_BOOT` build option).

* Currently we are not aware of any ways in which Mender "gets in the way" of Secure Boot, but it is
  not actively supported. For this reason, Northern.tech cannot guarantee that Mender will work with
  Secure Boot images using Yocto.
